# GL Classification and Revaluation Refactor — Execution Ledger

Last reconciled: 2026-09-03 (Africa/Accra)

## Objective

Execute the approved GL classification and revaluation refactor in bounded phases, preserving Finance ownership and V1 external-producer compatibility until a separately coordinated cutover.

## Authoritative inputs

- `docs/Finance/GL_CLASSIFICATION_REVALUATION_REFACTOR_HANDOFF.md`
- `docs/Finance/GL_CLASSIFICATION_PHASE0_ASSESSMENT.md`
- `docs/Finance/GL_CLASSIFICATION_PHASE0_CONSUMER_INVENTORY.md`
- `docs/Finance/FINANCE_AGENT_COORDINATION_PROTOCOL.md`

## Authorization

The user authorized the coordinator to:

- communicate with and manage the active implementing task directly;
- review results and issue corrections without user relaying;
- authorize the next already-approved phase after satisfactory review;
- cherry-pick clean, reviewed Finance commits into the primary Finance branch.

The coordinator must stop at the escalation gates in the coordination protocol, including migrations/database mutations, cross-module implementation changes, destructive actions, conflicts with concurrent work, pushes, and PR operations.

## Phase 1A review checklist

- [x] Handoff supplies exact base, branch, worktree, ordered commits, changed files, tests, migration state, dependencies, and unresolved findings.
- [x] Work remains inside the authorized Finance-only Phase 1A boundary.
- [x] V1 external producer compatibility is preserved.
- [x] Accounting-book authority and V2 contracts match the approved Phase 0 decisions.
- [x] Central posting enforcement fails closed and exact reversal behavior is preserved or strengthened.
- [x] Startup SQL, deterministic seeding, migrations, and model snapshot are mutually consistent.
- [x] Relevant backend, contract, migration, and frontend tests pass or all baseline failures are evidenced.
- [x] No migration or database mutation was performed without authorization.
- [x] Integration conflicts and dependencies were checked before cherry-picking; no dirty-file path overlapped.

## Review cycles

| Cycle | Implementer HEAD | Result | Findings/corrections | Integration result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `f50f460612bd301e9082b85b5efd228f44a636a7` | `CHANGES_REQUIRED` | P1: exact-reversal validation bypass for ordinary V1/V2 requests; recurring-reversal test fake no longer compiles; migration snapshot has pending model changes; used classifications can be retired/demoted and invalidate live mappings. P2: account-book rowversion is not round-tripped, so stale web edits can overwrite assignments. Corrections and required tests were sent directly to the implementer. | Not integrated |
| 2 | `d282be9c3a39a35d1d24ca0c8c85823ce415233b` | `APPROVED` | All five findings closed. Independent verification: 68 focused tests, EF no-pending-model check and diff check passed; worktree clean. Primary tree matches the reviewed task tree for every task-owned file. | Fourteen commits cherry-picked without conflict as `8c78c3a6` through `5a6d55f3`. Primary isolated-output build passed with 0 errors and 78 focused tests passed. Migration remains unapplied. |

## Phase 2 review cycles

| Cycle | Implementer HEAD | Result | Findings/corrections | Integration result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `1d6521e4976c0e9334dd7290e8d5c47d715ca2f2` | `CHANGES_REQUIRED` | P1: deterministic v1-to-v2 seed upgrades are incomplete for existing tenants; dashboard aggregation is not bound to one authoritative book; classification mutation/audit and relationship checks are not atomic; singleton system-role cardinality is unenforced. P2: ad-hoc Chart of Accounts book/tenant selection is nondeterministic; mutation controls lack permission-aware UI gating; parent retirement readiness disagrees with backend lifecycle rules. Corrections and required regression gates were sent directly. | Not integrated |
| 2 | `62f1a138efaaef78b5bcf2f7e4a1e3776ffb518b` | `APPROVED` | All seven findings closed. Independent verification passed 58 backend tests, 9 frontend tests, targeted ESLint, EF no-pending-model and diff checks. The worktree was clean and no persistent database was mutated. | Six commits cherry-picked without conflict as `ff6e35b6`, `e8a31156`, `b11099a3`, `81426b0a`, `81f28b26`, and `8a026995`. Primary verification passed: test-project build with 0 errors, 137 focused backend tests, 9 frontend tests, targeted ESLint, EF no-pending-model, and diff check. Migration remains unapplied. |

## Phase 3 review cycles

| Cycle | Implementer HEAD | Result | Findings/corrections | Integration result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Pending | Implementation active | Classification-driven layouts, immutable publication snapshots, exact-book execution, import/export compatibility, protected standards, where-used evidence and legacy-runtime replacement are assigned. | Pending |

## Connectivity checkpoint

Last verified durable point: Phase 2 is independently approved and recorded through primary commit `d7bf1767`. The user authorized Phase 3, and the existing implementing task was reactivated with exact base `d7bf1767`, a new isolated worktree/branch, immutable published-classification snapshot requirements, Finance-only boundaries, and unapplied-migration policy. Earlier migrations, including `20260903120000_EnforceFinanceClassificationSystemRoleCardinality`, remain unapplied; no persistent database was mutated.

## Next action

Monitor the Phase 3 implementation handoff. Independently review publication reproducibility, transactionality, permissions, concurrency, import compatibility and migration metadata; send corrections directly until approved. Integrate only a clean approved stack and do not apply migrations or begin Phase 4 without authorization.
