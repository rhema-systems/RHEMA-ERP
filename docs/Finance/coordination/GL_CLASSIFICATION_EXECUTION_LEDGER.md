# GL Classification and Revaluation Refactor — Execution Ledger

Last reconciled: 2026-09-03 (Africa/Accra)

## Authoritative inputs

## Authorization

The user authorized the coordinator to:

- communicate with and manage the active implementing task directly;
- review results and issue corrections without user relaying;
- continue automatically through Phases 3–6, issuing each next phase immediately after satisfactory independent review and integration;
- cherry-pick clean, reviewed Finance commits into the primary Finance branch.

The implementing task should not be left idle between these approved phases. User intervention is reserved for the escalation gates below or an unrecoverable blocker.

The coordinator must stop at the escalation gates in the coordination protocol, including migrations/database mutations, cross-module implementation changes, destructive actions, conflicts with concurrent work, pushes, and PR operations.

## Phase 1A review checklist

- [x] Handoff supplies exact base, branch, worktree, ordered commits, changed files, tests, migration state, dependencies, and unresolved findings.
- [x] Work remains inside the authorized Finance-only Phase 1A boundary.
- [x] V1 external producer compatibility is preserved.
- [x] Accounting-book authority and V2 contracts match the approved Phase 0 decisions.
- [x] Central posting enforcement fails closed and exact reversal behavior is preserved or strengthened.
- [x] Startup SQL, deterministic seeding, migrations, and model snapshot are mutually consistent.
- [x] Relevant backend, contract, migration, and frontend tests pass or all baseline failures are evidenced.
- [x] No migration or database mutation was performed without authorization.
- [x] Integration conflicts and dependencies were checked before cherry-picking; no dirty-file path overlapped.

## Review cycles

| Cycle | Implementer HEAD | Result | Findings/corrections | Integration result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `f50f460612bd301e9082b85b5efd228f44a636a7` | `CHANGES_REQUIRED` | P1: exact-reversal validation bypass for ordinary V1/V2 requests; recurring-reversal test fake no longer compiles; migration snapshot has pending model changes; used classifications can be retired/demoted and invalidate live mappings. P2: account-book rowversion is not round-tripped, so stale web edits can overwrite assignments. Corrections and required tests were sent directly to the implementer. | Not integrated |
| 2 | `d282be9c3a39a35d1d24ca0c8c85823ce415233b` | `APPROVED` | All five findings closed. Independent verification: 68 focused tests, EF no-pending-model check and diff check passed; worktree clean. Primary tree matches the reviewed task tree for every task-owned file. | Fourteen commits cherry-picked without conflict as `8c78c3a6` through `5a6d55f3`. Primary isolated-output build passed with 0 errors and 78 focused tests passed. Migration remains unapplied. |

## Phase 2 review cycles

| Cycle | Implementer HEAD | Result | Findings/corrections | Integration result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `1d6521e4976c0e9334dd7290e8d5c47d715ca2f2` | `CHANGES_REQUIRED` | P1: deterministic v1-to-v2 seed upgrades are incomplete for existing tenants; dashboard aggregation is not bound to one authoritative book; classification mutation/audit and relationship checks are not atomic; singleton system-role cardinality is unenforced. P2: ad-hoc Chart of Accounts book/tenant selection is nondeterministic; mutation controls lack permission-aware UI gating; parent retirement readiness disagrees with backend lifecycle rules. Corrections and required regression gates were sent directly. | Not integrated |
| 2 | `62f1a138efaaef78b5bcf2f7e4a1e3776ffb518b` | `APPROVED` | All seven findings closed. Independent verification passed 58 backend tests, 9 frontend tests, targeted ESLint, EF no-pending-model and diff checks. The worktree was clean and no persistent database was mutated. | Six commits cherry-picked without conflict as `ff6e35b6`, `e8a31156`, `b11099a3`, `81426b0a`, `81f28b26`, and `8a026995`. Primary verification passed: test-project build with 0 errors, 137 focused backend tests, 9 frontend tests, targeted ESLint, EF no-pending-model, and diff check. Migration remains unapplied. |

## Phase 3 review cycles

| Cycle | Implementer HEAD | Result | Findings/corrections | Integration result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `ab53f09e503efd6fee9205129f841b1f5de4bce2` | `CHANGES_REQUIRED` | P2: V2 JSON imports accept classification ID without the required portable stable code; UI view access treats action permissions as substitutes for the API's Finance.Read prerequisite; publication fingerprints omit the frozen book name and per-row book ID/code. Corrections and targeted regression requirements were sent directly. The unrelated Supplier Returns lockdown baseline was independently confirmed unchanged. | Not integrated |
| 2 | `534fa89696bed17cfe4e6f456b02df760ff98ed7` | `APPROVED` | All three findings closed. Independent verification passed 24 backend and 15 frontend tests, targeted ESLint, EF no-pending-model and diff checks. V2 imports require portable stable classification codes; UI/API read authority is aligned; publication fingerprint v2 covers all frozen book evidence and fails closed on tampering. | Four commits cherry-picked without conflict as `b4af3e4d`, `657cc5d4`, `b6dd0611`, and `48610595`. Primary task-owned blobs match the reviewed tree. Primary verification passed: test-project build with 0 errors, 24 focused backend tests, 15 frontend tests, targeted ESLint, EF no-pending-model, and diff check. Migration remains unapplied. |

## Phase 4 review cycles

| Cycle | Implementer HEAD | Result | Findings/corrections | Integration result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `1716ba43f18758685ef4b56c3796486e172db4f6` | Independent review active | Clean three-commit stack delivers exact-book/account/currency policy, governed override lifecycle, signed revaluation mathematics, immutable preview/batch evidence, UI, tests, documentation and migration. Review is focused on accounting direction, workflow/audit atomicity, book isolation, fingerprint completeness, seed preservation and migration preflight. | Pending |

## Connectivity checkpoint

Last verified durable point: Phase 4 recovered from the transient service interruption and returned a clean three-commit stack at `1716ba43f18758685ef4b56c3796486e172db4f6`, based exactly on `a4ea150a7f8bd6fd7fec343bc1baed83f8fa030d`. The coordinator verified the base, ordered commits, clean worktree, Finance-only changed-file inventory, migration metadata and diff check, then activated independent review. Migration `20260903190453_AddBookScopedFxRevaluationPolicy` and all earlier migrations remain unapplied; no persistent database was mutated.

## Next action

Complete independent Phase 4 accounting/schema/security review and send any corrections directly. Integrate only an approved clean stack, rerun primary gates, update the ledger, then immediately activate Phase 5 from the resulting exact primary checkpoint. Do not apply migrations or cross any other escalation gate without user authorization.
